# ANN - SNN

- Download `ann.ipynb` and `ann_train.csv` to replicate my work
- You need these libraries:
  1. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
  2. [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
  3. [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
  4. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html)
- In addition to them you need inbuilt modules like copy and random

## Results

- got around 98% accuracy for `Arrhythmia_classifier`

  ![Arrhythmia_classifier results](classifier_result.jpg)

- ANN and SNN networks can be calculated now. Download [spikes.ipynb](spikes.ipynb) file and run it with the biases and weights you got after running the `Arrhythmia_classifier` model from [ann.ipynb](ann.ipynb) .
